        <h1>Cookies & Privacy</h1>
        <p>
            We use cookies to enhance your browsing experience, analyze site traffic, and personalize content.
            By clicking "Accept", you consent to our use of cookies.
            Cookie text is the message on a website to inform users about cookies and for what purpose they are used.
            Various data
            protection laws require websites to provide their users with this information to obtain voluntary consent
            for using
            cookies. This notification or message appears on a websiteâ€™s consent banner.

            Cookie texts differ from the cookie policy statements, which is a detailed account of what cookies are
            deployed on the
            site, how they will be used, and how the users can manage them (especially the third-party settings).

            Website cookie consent text is usually the first thing the users will see when they visit a website. When
            the user
            visits a website for the first time, the website must ask for consent to use cookies before storing them on
            user
            devices. Therefore, a cookie banner or notice to inform them about cookies and to ask their permission is a
            mandatory
            requirement.
